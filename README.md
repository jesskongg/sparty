## Introduction
Sparty is a web application that provides real-time jukebox rooms where a user can join and suggest songs into a queue from Spotify and everyone else can vote up which songs in the queue they want to hear next. The application will pick the song with the most votes to play.

#### Original idea
This is the final project idea for the CMPT470 course (SFU). The project was not successful due to disagreement in implementation. I redesigned and implemnented all features to serve my own need.
