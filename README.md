## Introduction
Sparty is a web application where users join virtual rooms, add songs to a playlist, and vote on songs. The song with the most votes is automatically played next.

## Overview of Design
















#### Background
The idea for Sparty originated as a course project in CMPT 470 (Web-based Information Systems). I have independently redeveloped the application to include new features and an improved user experience.
